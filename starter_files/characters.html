      </ul>
      <p>Marco is Star's best friend. He is kind, responsible, very organized, and supportive of others. He has a reputation at his school for being the "safe kid" due to avoiding danger and being cautious, though he insists that he is a "misunderstood bad boy".

      <ul>
      <li>Ludo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ludo is a major anatogist of Star vs. the Forces of Evil. In the season 1, he uses an army of monsters in the order to steal Star's wand and take over the universe. As of season 2, however, he has his own wand and new monster followers. Toward the end of season 2, his body is possessed by Toffee.
